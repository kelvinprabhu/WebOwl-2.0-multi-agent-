The programs are designed to develop skills, creative and critical thinking while fostering values of empathy and community engagement. Approved by the Council of Architecture New Delhi and AICTE, the school offers a Bachelor’s Degree Program in Architecture (B Arch) and Master’s Degree Program in Architecture (M Arch). The curriculum us built upon three core principles – the teaching andragogy of experiential learning, service through outreach programs, along with ‘Studio on Wheels’, a unique travel based studio program. Overview The Programmes intend a deep immersion in an ecosophical perspective of built environment, as part of an inspired understanding of larger discourses: environmental, social, political, artistic and technological. The B Arch Programme sensitises students to be socially and environmentally responsible and to work effectively in multi-disciplinary teams within the field of human habitat; engaging them in community outreach programs and assimilate knowledge in built environment related disciplines that are relevant to ethical practice in architecture. The programs nurtures quality education that enables use and extension of appropriate knowledge for designing built environment; stimulating critical thinking to assess existing environment in the service of the discipline of architecture. The education at School of Architecture, offers sound knowledge in design theories and their applications, building technology, social, cultural, gender and environmental issues; learning to apply interdisciplinary knowledge and use tools that enable it. It inculcates skills necessary for the physical, social and creative realms of crafting architecture; preparing students to recognise and act upon opportunities and aspirations; instilling creative problem-solving skills, enhancing entrepreneurship, by offering active and experiential learning while working with varied materials and media. The school aims at developing skills of architectural design and effective communication of ideas to peers, clients, decision makers, and the public. The M Arch Programme intends to provide an education in the field of built environment that recognises its interdisciplinary nature between urbanism, ecology, social, economic and political realms; to offer learning that encourages a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach and bridges the gap between academics and practice. The school offers training in research on urban and ecological issues of the global south and specifically in the context of Asia. The programme provides an education in design, advocacy and activism and offers courses that are domain specific, issue based that are relevant and contemporary. Choice based credit systems are offered to help specialise in specific disciplinary choices. Vision The School of Architecture CHRIST is dedicated to an architectural education through excellence and rigor in learning, research and community engagement to nurture individuals to become ethical professionals, creative designers and responsible citizens. Mission We believe in a responsible design thinking that is deeply sensitive to ecology, cultural diversity and social equity. Architectural education at our School will nurture inquisitiveness, creative inquiry and critical thinking towards the built environment and its related natural and cultural setting. The School commits itself to an integrated education in the art, science, history and technical skill for a sensitive, inclusive and collaborative practice in the discipline of architecture.

We are committed to providing a tremendous opportunity, to engage in an experiential learning environment using the Design studio space as a design thinking workshop, where ideas are explored and theoretical subjects are integrated. The Studio on Wheels the traveling classroom is a unique pedagogical approach adopted for an experiential teaching-learning practice in our education at CHRIST. These intensive studio sessions are designed to engage deeper learning and discourse on social and environmental issues, set within a selected geographic area or community precinct thus rendering a global perspective to the curriculum. It is built around community-driven skill development workshops, service-learning modules, master classes, outreach projects, and detailed documentation. The learnings set the premise and research questions for the design problem conducted in the subsequent three-quarters of the semester. The productions of these studios on wheels are documented comprehensively and released as publications or exhibitions in the public domain for wider dissemination, debate, and discourse. Our close working relationship with the existing ecosystem of the University has rendered a unique identity to the curriculum, building a deeper social and environmental responsibility within students. As we embrace the new dimensions of National education policy we extend ourselves to examine and participate in the rural reconstruction of the region. The CHRIST Rural Studio rolled out as a social outreach studio project, at semester 4 level, explores poetics in bamboo while learning appropriate technology. This funded research project is primarily intended to encourage student research and publication at the undergraduate level. With challenges such as liveability, infrastructure, climate change mitigation, culture and heritage, enforcement of existing legislative framework, and governance remaining at the forefront, our post-graduation pedagogy recognizes the interconnectedness between ecology, urbanism, and architecture. The program intends a deeper understanding of urbanism across scales and sectors including ecological, regional, urban and infrastructural, institutional, recreational, heritage, and the like. The school is currently expanding the policy of inclusiveness and encouraging more involvement of a diversity of students, developing research as a culture of the School and new multi-disciplinary collaborations. In our efforts to build inclusive classrooms, during this pandemic, we take special care to build trust with students and to stay inspired.

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! Read More Vishrutha Amudan Geo-Marketer, Zoho Corporation I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'.

My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Read More Vevek Shah Student of London Business School Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read More Michael John Dsouza Analyst : Innsaei Ventures, UK I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future. Also, on a practical front, I was always involved in co-curriculars through festing and clubs which developed my skills that were very useful in my academia as well as my current professional career. Read More Anussha Narain Account Manager Dineout, Times Internet Christ (Deemed to be University) is always going to be very close to my heart. I spent my 3 years there learning and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream.

We are proud and thrilled to have you in our team. The school consists of the Department of English and Cultural Studies, the Department of Performing Arts, Theatre and Music, Department of Languages and Department of Theology and Philosophy. This school is the nurturing ground for academic engagements that blend the study of art, culture, literature, history and philosophy. The school offers subjects that help you delve into inquiry and reasoning that goes beyond the written words. Delving deep in history, philosophy, critical studies, cultural studies, and more, this school takes the learner into a self- reflective journey. The moral and social responsibility of students of Humanities is to understand existing knowledge, reflect and question the past and the present, posit concepts and ideas to equate with contemporary times and construct new knowledge. You have this rare privilege of contributing to the thought system of the coming generation. Socrates, the great thinker and philosopher once said, “Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people.” At CHRIST, we want you to propel the stagnant thoughts and rusted minds that have long forgotten the light of wisdom. Here is a place that provides you with opportunities to deliberate on ideas, question and debate, read and analyse, discuss and generate new propositions for a future that you would create. Together may we learn to grow and contribute to the progress and development of the university and the society at large. Come engage yourself in deep learning and in honing your skills for a world that you would define!

Overwhelmed is one of the many words to express my feelings when I think about my college. Five years back, I joined Christ (Deemed to be University) as a student with splendid dreams yet uncertain about the possibilities that I have.

The highlight of the department is the vivid and well equipped team of professors, who taught me to develop a critical mind set on every issue. The togetherness amongst the diverse members of the department is especially visible during the variety of fests the department conducts. Altogether, the Media studies department is an educational treat which helped me utilize my talents and become a better person academically and personally.

Three years of my life spent here shook up potentials within me I never knew existed! And this was possible because I had these amazing bunch of talented and creative individuals that I call my teachers, the ones who made learning so dynamic, the knowledge they shared broadened so many perspectives, and the best part, it was down right fun. Everyday in our department was a challenge - spent on educating, and empowering students to be the best, most quirkiest version of themselves. The media department will have your creative juices flowing, helping you tackle one thought provoking problem after another, bringing out your originality to the maximum Read More Kanhai Designation This department has (and always will have) a very special place in my heart. It served as a collaborative learning space, and functioned as a foster ground for not only ideas but also people. With its emphasis on shared creativity and participation, the department through its myriad academic as well as non-academic activities has facilitated my personal growth. It was here that I began to lay the foundation for my future, and it wouldn’t have been possible without the incessant support and mentorship provided by the faculty. I take great pride in saying that my present and future traces back to this wonderful place, in how it has shaped and inspired me! Read More Diya Designation My experience of pursuing Journalism Honours at CHRIST, has truly been a memorable one. What this program has done for me extends beyond the classroom; I believe I have grown as an individual, which is an ode to my learning, interaction and the opportunities that this course presented me with. Journalism Honours is a course that makes you think, reflect, ideate and execute which in itself is a phenomenal process of learning. I am extremely grateful for the Faculty members who taught concepts which I am still actively applying in professional and educational spheres of my life. Be it comprehending marketing strategies through understanding symbols, seeking reliable sources of news, blending in with new media tools, articulating my research and thought and looking for context and greater understanding of things- I have learnt how to learn all thanks to my course and the team that carries it forward. I am grateful for having been a part of the Media Studies Cluster at CHRIST. Read More Prashant Parvatneni Srishti Institue of Art (2010-2013)/(2013-2015) When I came to Christ University in 2010, I had a very vague sense of purpose. I was fascinated with the form of cinema, and that led me to imagine that I should work in the area of media and arts. Apart from that, I had little to no understanding of art and aesthetics be it literary, visual or cinematic. It was in my literature classes at Christ, that I developed an understanding of looking at art or 'reading' critically. I realised that the act of reading into works of literature and art was more than a mere academic exercise for me, it was a pursuit of pleasure. This understanding would've escaped me without the training I received in the art of reading by the teachers of the English Department. My undergraduate literature classes thrilled me so much that I shifted gears away from a career in Media, and decided to come back to Christ for a Masters degree in English. Our master's course was unique because it placed equal emphasis on creative practice as on theoretical research. I immensely enjoyed papers like Creative Writing and Theatre in Practice, along with activities like Srujana (service learning) and film clubs, while also learning to appreciate the rigorous process of academic research in Research Methods classes. I am happy that today, I am involved in research and teaching with The Kabir Project at Srishti Institute of Art where we are archiving the oral traditions of spiritual poetry in India, and also simultaneously involved in the practice of creative writing independently. I hope I can keep finding ways for a co-existence of academic and creative pursuits in my life, and let each approach inform the other. I hope to finish my doctoral studies soon and teach actively (a passion I picked up during my days in Christ), while also continuing to write poetry and fiction.

Not only was it extremely fun to play Blanche DuBois, but it was also illuminating to find new kinds of writing in what I think is one of the most diverse curricula in my college experience. My time at Christ studying English instilled in me a deep knowledge and love of a wide range of literatures, and a flair for theatre (and theatrics) that has followed me since.

BA PSEnglish (2011-2014) I was committed to Jabberwocky-the annual Literary carnival, hosted by the English Department as part of my Bachelors program between 2011 - 2014. The facilitators always helped us to find the questions within our personal spaces, and expand them to the Universe out there. I was so inspired after reading 'Leaves of Grass' by Walt Whitman, that I decided to take my bicycle on a solo trip from Bangalore to Jaipur, and then Jaipur to Vietnam. I cycled through 7 countries in a span of 8 months, and relived all that I had learned in my classes on this journey. Studying English Literature at Christ University helped me to get in touch with my own voice, and be able to express it to the world.

They ve always provided me with ample resources for my academics and also support for my extra curricular endeavours × Testimonials Overwhelmed is one of the many words to express my feelings when I think about my college. Five years back, I joined Christ (Deemed to be University) as a student with splendid dreams yet uncertain about the possibilities that I have. Today, I could see the transformation that I have undergone—erudite and sophisticated.The selfless and dedicated efforts of the faculty are worth mentioning that makes me count myself into a better professional. With an attitude of being ever ready to facilitate besides the classroom lecture, they have always been pillars of both life and learning. × Testimonials The English Honours programme helped me to better engage with my own thoughts and beliefs as well as empathise with other people’s thoughts and beliefs. The courses offered under the programme engage with all aspects of our being such as gender, disability, caste, class, nature, environment and so on. This wholesome orientation of the programme enabled me to understand different ways of the society by engaging me in a process of learning and unlearning. × Testimonials Education is about learning to unlearn', this is exactly what the Media studies department taught me during the course of my study there. The highlight of the department is the vivid and well equipped team of professors, who taught me to develop a critical mind set on every issue. The togetherness amongst the diverse members of the department is especially visible during the variety of fests the department conducts. Altogether, the Media studies department is an educational treat which helped me utilize my talents and become a better person academically and personally. × Testimonials It's a matter of pride when I say - hands down - I was a part of the coolest department on campus! Three years of my life spent here shook up potentials within me I never knew existed! And this was possible because I had these amazing bunch of talented and creative individuals that I call my teachers, the ones who made learning so dynamic, the knowledge they shared broadened so many perspectives, and the best part, it was down right fun.

Personally, liberal arts has helped me acquire dynamic positions where I’m a growth lead at a pharmaceutical based company and only my multidisciplinary education has helped me think in ways that integrate various different approaches to my daily problem solving. I also have started my own company which is completely different from my 9-5 and I was only able to do that because I was not limited to just one discipline. It’s helped me actively manage multiple things at once even when they aren’t interrelated but also allowed myself to find connections in the two areas of my career paths and find dynamic solutions that work for both!

The numerous activities, internships, and capstone projects I engaged in during my time in college also showcased practical exposure even as a fresher.

As an international student I was offered with helping hands from faculty , staff members specifically from the office of International Affairs who they have been generous with their time being dedicated to students. Sincere gratitude to CHRIST University, for providing me the platform of growth and prosper to become a better individual. × Testimonials Christ University was unfamiliar to me before I visited India. I joined the University to pursue my studies and once I came to India, there were language and cultural barriers which made it hard for me to communicate and understand people. But a few months into Christ, I was able to communicate better in the English language, thanks to the amicable students and friendly atmosphere. Christ university has made me disciplined and responsible, all because of the rules and regulations regarding attendance, assignments and dress code. Through my years in Christ I have been able to develop my skills and knowledge and work towards my goal. I wish to thank my friends and extend my gratitude to the University for its constant efforts in moulding me into the person that I am today. × Testimonials The whole reason I came to India was to get a different college experience.

The programs are designed to develop skills, creative and critical thinking while fostering values of empathy and community engagement. Approved by the Council of Architecture New Delhi and AICTE, the school offers a Bachelor’s Degree Program in Architecture (B Arch) and Master’s Degree Program in Architecture (M Arch). The curriculum us built upon three core principles – the teaching andragogy of experiential learning, service through outreach programs, along with ‘Studio on Wheels’, a unique travel based studio program. Overview The Programmes intend a deep immersion in an ecosophical perspective of built environment, as part of an inspired understanding of larger discourses: environmental, social, political, artistic and technological. The B Arch Programme sensitises students to be socially and environmentally responsible and to work effectively in multi-disciplinary teams within the field of human habitat; engaging them in community outreach programs and assimilate knowledge in built environment related disciplines that are relevant to ethical practice in architecture. The programs nurtures quality education that enables use and extension of appropriate knowledge for designing built environment; stimulating critical thinking to assess existing environment in the service of the discipline of architecture. The education at School of Architecture, offers sound knowledge in design theories and their applications, building technology, social, cultural, gender and environmental issues; learning to apply interdisciplinary knowledge and use tools that enable it. It inculcates skills necessary for the physical, social and creative realms of crafting architecture; preparing students to recognise and act upon opportunities and aspirations; instilling creative problem-solving skills, enhancing entrepreneurship, by offering active and experiential learning while working with varied materials and media. The school aims at developing skills of architectural design and effective communication of ideas to peers, clients, decision makers, and the public. The M Arch Programme intends to provide an education in the field of built environment that recognises its interdisciplinary nature between urbanism, ecology, social, economic and political realms; to offer learning that encourages a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach and bridges the gap between academics and practice. The school offers training in research on urban and ecological issues of the global south and specifically in the context of Asia. The programme provides an education in design, advocacy and activism and offers courses that are domain specific, issue based that are relevant and contemporary. Choice based credit systems are offered to help specialise in specific disciplinary choices. Vision The School of Architecture CHRIST is dedicated to an architectural education through excellence and rigor in learning, research and community engagement to nurture individuals to become ethical professionals, creative designers and responsible citizens. Mission We believe in a responsible design thinking that is deeply sensitive to ecology, cultural diversity and social equity. Architectural education at our School will nurture inquisitiveness, creative inquiry and critical thinking towards the built environment and its related natural and cultural setting. The School commits itself to an integrated education in the art, science, history and technical skill for a sensitive, inclusive and collaborative practice in the discipline of architecture.

We are committed to providing a tremendous opportunity, to engage in an experiential learning environment using the Design studio space as a design thinking workshop, where ideas are explored and theoretical subjects are integrated. The Studio on Wheels the traveling classroom is a unique pedagogical approach adopted for an experiential teaching-learning practice in our education at CHRIST. These intensive studio sessions are designed to engage deeper learning and discourse on social and environmental issues, set within a selected geographic area or community precinct thus rendering a global perspective to the curriculum. It is built around community-driven skill development workshops, service-learning modules, master classes, outreach projects, and detailed documentation. The learnings set the premise and research questions for the design problem conducted in the subsequent three-quarters of the semester. The productions of these studios on wheels are documented comprehensively and released as publications or exhibitions in the public domain for wider dissemination, debate, and discourse. Our close working relationship with the existing ecosystem of the University has rendered a unique identity to the curriculum, building a deeper social and environmental responsibility within students. As we embrace the new dimensions of National education policy we extend ourselves to examine and participate in the rural reconstruction of the region. The CHRIST Rural Studio rolled out as a social outreach studio project, at semester 4 level, explores poetics in bamboo while learning appropriate technology. This funded research project is primarily intended to encourage student research and publication at the undergraduate level. With challenges such as liveability, infrastructure, climate change mitigation, culture and heritage, enforcement of existing legislative framework, and governance remaining at the forefront, our post-graduation pedagogy recognizes the interconnectedness between ecology, urbanism, and architecture. The program intends a deeper understanding of urbanism across scales and sectors including ecological, regional, urban and infrastructural, institutional, recreational, heritage, and the like. The school is currently expanding the policy of inclusiveness and encouraging more involvement of a diversity of students, developing research as a culture of the School and new multi-disciplinary collaborations. In our efforts to build inclusive classrooms, during this pandemic, we take special care to build trust with students and to stay inspired.

The programs are designed to develop skills, creative and critical thinking while fostering values of empathy and community engagement. Approved by the Council of Architecture New Delhi and AICTE, the school offers a Bachelor’s Degree Program in Architecture (B Arch) and Master’s Degree Program in Architecture (M Arch). The curriculum us built upon three core principles – the teaching andragogy of experiential learning, service through outreach programs, along with ‘Studio on Wheels’, a unique travel based studio program. Overview The Programmes intend a deep immersion in an ecosophical perspective of built environment, as part of an inspired understanding of larger discourses: environmental, social, political, artistic and technological. The B Arch Programme sensitises students to be socially and environmentally responsible and to work effectively in multi-disciplinary teams within the field of human habitat; engaging them in community outreach programs and assimilate knowledge in built environment related disciplines that are relevant to ethical practice in architecture. The programs nurtures quality education that enables use and extension of appropriate knowledge for designing built environment; stimulating critical thinking to assess existing environment in the service of the discipline of architecture. The education at School of Architecture, offers sound knowledge in design theories and their applications, building technology, social, cultural, gender and environmental issues; learning to apply interdisciplinary knowledge and use tools that enable it. It inculcates skills necessary for the physical, social and creative realms of crafting architecture; preparing students to recognise and act upon opportunities and aspirations; instilling creative problem-solving skills, enhancing entrepreneurship, by offering active and experiential learning while working with varied materials and media. The school aims at developing skills of architectural design and effective communication of ideas to peers, clients, decision makers, and the public. The M Arch Programme intends to provide an education in the field of built environment that recognises its interdisciplinary nature between urbanism, ecology, social, economic and political realms; to offer learning that encourages a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach and bridges the gap between academics and practice. The school offers training in research on urban and ecological issues of the global south and specifically in the context of Asia. The programme provides an education in design, advocacy and activism and offers courses that are domain specific, issue based that are relevant and contemporary. Choice based credit systems are offered to help specialise in specific disciplinary choices. Vision The School of Architecture CHRIST is dedicated to an architectural education through excellence and rigor in learning, research and community engagement to nurture individuals to become ethical professionals, creative designers and responsible citizens. Mission We believe in a responsible design thinking that is deeply sensitive to ecology, cultural diversity and social equity. Architectural education at our School will nurture inquisitiveness, creative inquiry and critical thinking towards the built environment and its related natural and cultural setting. The School commits itself to an integrated education in the art, science, history and technical skill for a sensitive, inclusive and collaborative practice in the discipline of architecture.

We are committed to providing a tremendous opportunity, to engage in an experiential learning environment using the Design studio space as a design thinking workshop, where ideas are explored and theoretical subjects are integrated. The Studio on Wheels the traveling classroom is a unique pedagogical approach adopted for an experiential teaching-learning practice in our education at CHRIST. These intensive studio sessions are designed to engage deeper learning and discourse on social and environmental issues, set within a selected geographic area or community precinct thus rendering a global perspective to the curriculum. It is built around community-driven skill development workshops, service-learning modules, master classes, outreach projects, and detailed documentation. The learnings set the premise and research questions for the design problem conducted in the subsequent three-quarters of the semester. The productions of these studios on wheels are documented comprehensively and released as publications or exhibitions in the public domain for wider dissemination, debate, and discourse. Our close working relationship with the existing ecosystem of the University has rendered a unique identity to the curriculum, building a deeper social and environmental responsibility within students. As we embrace the new dimensions of National education policy we extend ourselves to examine and participate in the rural reconstruction of the region. The CHRIST Rural Studio rolled out as a social outreach studio project, at semester 4 level, explores poetics in bamboo while learning appropriate technology. This funded research project is primarily intended to encourage student research and publication at the undergraduate level. With challenges such as liveability, infrastructure, climate change mitigation, culture and heritage, enforcement of existing legislative framework, and governance remaining at the forefront, our post-graduation pedagogy recognizes the interconnectedness between ecology, urbanism, and architecture. The program intends a deeper understanding of urbanism across scales and sectors including ecological, regional, urban and infrastructural, institutional, recreational, heritage, and the like. The school is currently expanding the policy of inclusiveness and encouraging more involvement of a diversity of students, developing research as a culture of the School and new multi-disciplinary collaborations. In our efforts to build inclusive classrooms, during this pandemic, we take special care to build trust with students and to stay inspired.

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! Vishrutha Amudan I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'. Sathwik Maanthini They say great leaders are not born but are made, and I strongly feel Christ Deemed to be a university is such a place which creates the perfect ambience and exposure that brings out the best of one's qualities and pushes him/her to their maximum potential. My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Vevek Shah Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Michael John Dsouza I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future. Also, on a practical front, I was always involved in co-curriculars through festing and clubs which developed my skills that were very useful in my academia as well as my current professional career. Anussha Narain Christ (Deemed to be University) is always going to be very close to my heart. I spent my 3 years there learning and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream. And as our anthem states \"Though we change with time, the Christite spirit survives\" March on Christites! Tanmayi R When I joined Christ university I was in the first Batch for the BBA in Finance and International Business course and part of the first batch to enter the new Bannerghatta campus. The course I selected was structured extremely well and in accordance with international standards. Other than academics christ provided me with opportunities to excel in extracurriculars like business feasting, entrepreneurship cell, sports and cultural events. Christ university also gave me a great platform to develop my leadership skills and gain technical knowledge in my core specialisation with a research focus, that helped me in my Master’s degree and well as my professional career. Dishank Christ university was my home away from home. Over the course of 3 years, I had an amazing learning experience which always encouraged me to explore opportunities out of my comfort zone. I gained invaluable first hand experience working with real organizations, experiences which I will continuously draw upon in my future career.

During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read more...

I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future.

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! Read More Vishrutha Amudan Geo-Marketer, Zoho Corporation I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'.

My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Read More Vevek Shah Student of London Business School Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read More Michael John Dsouza Analyst : Innsaei Ventures, UK I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future. Also, on a practical front, I was always involved in co-curriculars through festing and clubs which developed my skills that were very useful in my academia as well as my current professional career. Read More Anussha Narain Account Manager Dineout, Times Internet Christ (Deemed to be University) is always going to be very close to my heart. I spent my 3 years there learning and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream.

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! Read More Vishrutha Amudan Geo-Marketer, Zoho Corporation I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'. Read More Sathwik Maanthini Founder, Habbit and Homelyfit They say great leaders are not born but are made, and I strongly feel Christ Deemed to be a university is such a place which creates the perfect ambience and exposure that brings out the best of one's qualities and pushes him/her to their maximum potential. My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Read More Vevek Shah Student of London Business School Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read More Michael John Dsouza Analyst : Innsaei Ventures, UK I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future. Also, on a practical front, I was always involved in co-curriculars through festing and clubs which developed my skills that were very useful in my academia as well as my current professional career. Read More Anussha Narain Account Manager Dineout, Times Internet Christ (Deemed to be University) is always going to be very close to my heart. I spent my 3 years there learning and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream. And as our anthem states \"Though we change with time, the Christite spirit survives\" March on Christites!

The course I selected was structured extremely well and in accordance with international standards. Other than academics christ provided me with opportunities to excel in extracurriculars like business feasting, entrepreneurship cell, sports and cultural events.

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! Read More Vishrutha Amudan Geo-Marketer, Zoho Corporation I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'. Read More Sathwik Maanthini Founder, Habbit and Homelyfit They say great leaders are not born but are made, and I strongly feel Christ Deemed to be a university is such a place which creates the perfect ambience and exposure that brings out the best of one's qualities and pushes him/her to their maximum potential. My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Read More Vevek Shah Student of London Business School Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read More Michael John Dsouza Analyst : Innsaei Ventures, UK I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future. Also, on a practical front, I was always involved in co-curriculars through festing and clubs which developed my skills that were very useful in my academia as well as my current professional career. Read More Anussha Narain Account Manager Dineout, Times Internet Christ (Deemed to be University) is always going to be very close to my heart. I spent my 3 years there learning and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream.

The course I selected was structured extremely well and in accordance with international standards. Other than academics christ provided me with opportunities to excel in extracurriculars like business feasting, entrepreneurship cell, sports and cultural events.

I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing.

My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Read More Vevek Shah Student of London Business School Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read More Michael John Dsouza Analyst : Innsaei Ventures, UK I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future.

Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream.

I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing.

My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. × Testimonials Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! × Testimonials I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future.

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! Read More Vishrutha Amudan Geo-Marketer, Zoho Corporation I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'. Read More Sathwik Maanthini Founder, Habbit and Homelyfit They say great leaders are not born but are made, and I strongly feel Christ Deemed to be a university is such a place which creates the perfect ambience and exposure that brings out the best of one's qualities and pushes him/her to their maximum potential. My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Read More Vevek Shah Student of London Business School Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read More Michael John Dsouza Analyst : Innsaei Ventures, UK I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future. Also, on a practical front, I was always involved in co-curriculars through festing and clubs which developed my skills that were very useful in my academia as well as my current professional career.

I spent my 3 years there learning and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream.

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! Read More Vishrutha Amudan Geo-Marketer, Zoho Corporation I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'. Read More Sathwik Maanthini Founder, Habbit and Homelyfit They say great leaders are not born but are made, and I strongly feel Christ Deemed to be a university is such a place which creates the perfect ambience and exposure that brings out the best of one's qualities and pushes him/her to their maximum potential. My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. Read More Vevek Shah Student of London Business School Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed! Read More Michael John Dsouza Analyst : Innsaei Ventures, UK I believe, personally, Christ has taught me a lot. The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future. Also, on a practical front, I was always involved in co-curriculars through festing and clubs which developed my skills that were very useful in my academia as well as my current professional career. Read More Anussha Narain Account Manager Dineout, Times Internet Christ (Deemed to be University) is always going to be very close to my heart. I spent my 3 years there learning and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. Diversity, Opportunity & practical experience makes this college stand out and it not only offers excellent academic experience but also encourages students to have a more practical and wholesome real life experience through festing, internships and various cultural and management events. Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment. Every faculty member/ professor at Christ has molded and shown the right career path to numerous students successfully and I was lucky enough to have them as my guides in choosing the right career stream.

The course I selected was structured extremely well and in accordance with international standards.

I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing.

My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being.

The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer. While the lectures themselves are incredibly informative and interesting - there's so much more to Christ than the academics, and that's for the students to seize. During my time in Christ I was engaged in almost every extra-curricular activity that I felt an interest for - from being the student coordinator for the Synthesize International Conference hosted in collaboration with Arnhem Business School, Netherlands or leading with other final year students in the Entrepreneurship Cell. My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask!

The cohort was very diverse that makes you interact and collaborate with so many ethnicities which in the end helps you build a multi-cultural mindset for the future.

Christ University is the place that not only helped me shape my academic and practical skills but also helped develop my over all personality and life skills to a whole new augment.

My time here has been really motivating and telling, the professors here are incredible mentors who guide you every step of the way, all you need to do is ask! And it is certain that any student that passes through the portals of Christ is never the same person that stepped in, they are always more resilient, more holistic and better developed!

From getting opportunities to participate in quizzes all across the country to honing one's leadership skills, and from academics to assignments, it had it all. A memorable experience indeed! × Testimonials I graduated from Christ University with a Bachelors in Business Administration, specialising in marketing and I am currently working with Zoho Corporation as a Geo-marketer. I remember being fascinated by the beaming energy of the campus as I stepped into the university for the very first time. Christ has something amazing to offer for everyone, what worked for me as a business student was the extensive business festing experience the university offered, sparking my interest in the field of marketing. I strongly believe that the holistic curriculum combined with the scope to explore co-curricular and extra-curricular interests has helped me groom myself into a more confident version of myself, getting me equipped for the 'world of work'. × Testimonials They say great leaders are not born but are made, and I strongly feel Christ Deemed to be a university is such a place which creates the perfect ambience and exposure that brings out the best of one's qualities and pushes him/her to their maximum potential. My college gave me the push I needed to stand where I am today running two bootstrapped startups successfully. It taught me how to be a good manager, how to be a good leader and more than that it taught me how to be a generous and conscious human being. × Testimonials Christ University has always felt like a home to me, one where you meet so very many heterogeneous people from all across India, and in many cases, the world even. The three years I had the privilege of spending a year, were nothing short of a dream come true. Every single moment spent here was one of personal development and transformation for me, it truly groomed me for what the world has to offer.
